# Graphing Algorithms

Wrote breadth first search, depth first search and Djisktra's shortest weighted path algorithms in C++ to find shortest path to all vertices.

# What I Learned

* Why Djisktra's algorithm and its variations are so commonplace in the real world
* How algorithms like Google Maps work to find the shortest possible path to a destination through algorithms
